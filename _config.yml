about_content: | 
  I am currently serving as a Senior Algorithm Engineer at Xiaopeng Autonomous Driving Center, where I have the privilege of contributing significantly to the advancement of autonomous driving technology. My academic journey includes obtaining a Master's degree from the Department of Precision Instruments at Tsinghua University, following the completion of my Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng) degree in the Department of Automatic Control at Shandong University in 2017.

  My professional journey commenced as an Algorithm Engineer at JD X Research Department, where I immersed myself in cutting-edge projects that laid a strong foundation for my career. Building on that invaluable experience, my current role at Xiaopeng Autonomous Driving Center empowers me to delve deeper into the realms of machine learning, with a primary focus on their applications in the field of autonomous driving.

  These cumulative experiences have not only sharpened my skills but also ignited a profound passion for research and development in these domains. I am wholeheartedly dedicated to pushing the boundaries of knowledge and technology, with the ultimate goal of driving innovation and delivering groundbreaking solutions in the world of autonomous driving.

          (1) Responsible for Xiaopeng P5 mass production model prediction module (CNGP)
          
            - Delivered high-priority issues in OTA4, reducing the rate of false deceleration by over 20% and decreasing the takeover rate by over 30%.
            
            - Enriched a simulation test dataset with over 3000 different scenarios, including intersections, roundabouts, and merge scenarios.

          (2) Responsible for Xiaopeng G9 mass production model prediction module (CNGP, HNGP 2.0)

            - Achieved safety takeovers close to 1 per thousand kilometers for HNGP 2.0 and reduced false decelerations to nearly 4 per thousand kilometers.
    
            - Implemented interactive framework for small intersection prediction algorithms, increasing the vehicle's passing capability at small intersections by over 30%.
    
            - Introduced exit prediction and behavior imitation prediction models, resulting in safety takeovers occurring less than 1 per hundred kilometers.

          (3) Responsible for Xiaopeng G9 mass production model prediction module (XNGP 2.0)

            - Implemented features such as lane optimization at unmarked intersections and merge predictions, achieving a vehicle's passing capability comparable to CNGP at 80%.
    
            - Continuously improved algorithms for scenarios including intersections, roundabouts, small intersections, and cruise control in OTA3, addressing algorithm glitches and ensuring successful deployments in Shanghai and Beijing.
    
            - Completed crucial feature enhancements and algorithm glitch fixes in the XNGP 2.0 sprint plan, resulting in a reduction of takeover rates and false deceleration rates by over 20%.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
