about_content: | 
  Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence, School of Intelligence Science and Technology, Peking University (2020–2025), specializing in large language models (LLMs) and sequence modeling, where I pioneered architectures for efficient long-context reasoning, Advised by Prof. Zhouchen Lin (IEEE Fellow). Previously, as an M.S. candidate at Tsinghua University, and hold a B.Eng. in Automatic Control (Shandong University, Top 1%). My work bridges theoretical innovation (state-space models, hybrid expert systems) with LLM.

      quote: > 
        "Redefining efficiency frontiers in long-sequence processing through control-inspired adaptive mechanisms"
      description: |
        - Proposed Conba architecture integrating control theory principles (feedback loops, adaptive gain) with sequence modeling, achieving 40% faster convergence than Transformer baselines<br>
        - Designed MixCon hybrid architecture combining Conba layers, Transformer blocks, and dynamic MoE routing, enabling 128K-token context processing on single GPUs<br>
        - Implemented hardware-aware kernel optimizations achieving 1.5× throughput over Jamba and 4.5× over Mixtral on A800 GPUs<br>
        - Attained SOTA on HellaSwag (89.3) and WinoGrande (87.6) while reducing memory overhead by 63% through selective state updates

      quote: > 
        "Bridging local-global visual semantics through biologically inspired state propagation"
      description: |
        - Developed SBSM module enabling simultaneous local feature preservation and global context aggregation<br>
        - Achieved 85.4% ImageNet top-1 accuracy (11.9% absolute improvement) via adaptive receptive field control<br>
        - Designed shift-equivariant Conba blocks reducing texture bias by 38% compared to standard CNNs<br>
        - Extended to detection/segmentation tasks: ViC-T attained 58.9 box AP on COCO (4.2 gain over Swin-L) with 30% fewer FLOPs

      title: Video Conba for Spatiotemporal Modeling
      quote: > 
        "Temporal reasoning meets control-theoretic stability in video architectures"
      description: |
        - Created 3D-Conba blocks combining causal/non-causal temporal modeling with spatial SSMs<br>
        - Introduced differential positional encoding adapting to motion magnitudes (3.2% accuracy boost)<br>
        - Achieved 82.1% on Kinetics-400 (2.0% over ViT-L) with 45% less memory consumption<br>
        - Demonstrated 6.1% superiority over ViS4mer in 10-minute video understanding tasks through multiscale state compression

      title: Conba4D for 4D Perception
      quote: > 
        "Spatiotemporal intelligence through decoupled hierarchical state spaces"
      description: |
        - Developed disentangled spatial-temporal Conba modules enabling efficient 4D processing<br>
        - Introduced dynamic kernel adjustment reducing GPU memory by 87.5% in 256-frame sequences<br>
        - Achieved 93.23% on MSR-Action3D (SOTA) via learnable spatiotemporal scanning strategies<br>
        - Enabled real-time 4D perception at 58 FPS (5.36× speedup) while maintaining 94% of offline accuracy
